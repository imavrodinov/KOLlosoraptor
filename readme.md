KOLlosiraptor is a pet project born out of my own laziness and stupidity. This is an auto adventuring tool of sorts used to quickly and easily crunch massive amounts of adventures in KoL. The whole project is in the form of a TDD suite of features built around a simple Cucumber/Ruby stack. Feel free to fork and add extra zones to your liking.
NOTE: I do not condone the use of bots and/or any other kind of auto adventuring exploits. I can't be held responsible and/or bail you out if Jick gets you banned for botting. Use at your own risk!

TODO:
-automated eating/drinking incl. nightcaps (overdrinking before rollovers)
-automated gear swap before/after adventuring
-automated mall purchases based on lowest item price
-auto spell casting /w mana checks
